# Compound Interest Cruncher

This is a simple Android app developed to solve several simple problems involving compound interest, especially in a classroom setting.  It features the ability to calculate:

 * Present value, interest rate, number of periods, and future value.
 * An ordinary annuity or an annuity due.
 * Amortization tables.
 * Bonds.
 * Uneven Cash Flows.

## Instructions on Use

Most of the instructions are in the application and correspond to the fields directly under each set of instructions.  However, it is important to note that interest is currently input as a _decimal_, not a percent, and therefore 2% would be entered as .02 .  This may change in future versions.
